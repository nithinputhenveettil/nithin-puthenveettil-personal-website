Hi, I'm Nithin Puthenveettil, a passionate software engineer from India. My journey into coding started back in 2009 during my school days, and since then, I've been hooked on technology. I graduated in 2015 and have spent the last 10 years working in the IT industry.

I started out as a Node.js developer and worked with it for around five years before transitioning to Go (Golang). Since then, Go has become my primary programming language, and I’ve developed a strong passion for it. I enjoy building efficient, scalable systems with Go.

Aside from coding, I love working with scripts and tools in Linux, especially Fedora. I’m particularly fond of writing shell scripts and exploring the terminal—there’s something incredibly satisfying about automating tasks and solving problems through the command line.

Currently, I'm working at IBM, where I'm part of the team maintaining the Go Tracer SDK for IBM Instana, a tool that helps developers monitor and improve the performance of their applications. It’s an exciting challenge, and I enjoy working on it every day.

Beyond work, I have a passion for movies. I used to write movie reviews regularly, but now I do it occasionally. I also love writing short stories and fan fictions, where I get to let my imagination run wild. When I’m not coding or writing, you’ll often find me exploring new places on my motorcycle, a Royal Enfield Meteor 350. Traveling, especially on a bike, gives me a sense of freedom and adventure that I truly cherish.
